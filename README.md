## What is RGB-Maxwell?

RBG-Maxwell (**<font color="#dd0000">R</font>**elativistic **<font color="#0000dd">B</font>**oltzmann equation on **<font color="#00dd00">G</font>**PUs coupled with the **Maxwell**'s equations) is a general framework that simulates the (relativistic) collisional plasma systems in a fully consistent way on GPU clusters. Given the proper initial distributions of the relevant particles, RBG-Maxwell  is able to produce the subsequent states of the system. 


## What can RGB-Maxwell do?
