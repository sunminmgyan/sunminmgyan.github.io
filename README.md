## What is the RGB-Maxwell?

RBG-Maxwell (**<font color="#dd0000">R</font>**elativistic **<font color="#0000dd">B</font>**oltzmann equation on **<font color="#00dd00">G</font>**PUs coupled with the **Maxwell**'s equations) is a general framework that simulates the (relativistic) collisional plasma systems in a fully consistent way on GPU clusters. Given the proper initial distributions of the relevant particles, RBG-Maxwell  is able to produce the subsequent states of the system. 


## What can RGB-Maxwell do?

- Simulate the collision-less plasma systems with electrostatic/low frequency electromagnetic fields [[arXiv:2209.07944]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07944).
- Simulate the pre-equilibrium state of quark-gluon plasma in high energy heavy-ion collisions.
- Simulate the solar plasma in collisions.
- Simulate the collisional plasma involving quantum states or particle annihilation/production/ionization.
- Mimic the evolution of of Quark-Gluon plasma [[arXiv:1912.04457]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04457).
- Study the collisional effect of plasma systems. 
- etc ...
